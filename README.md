# Circular Pong (HTML Project)

#### Description: This project is a demonstration of the two most basic and arguably most important Trigonometric functions -- Sine and Cosine. Utilizing these two fundamental functions of a circle, an object is made to bounce from the first quadrant to the second quadrant, and back in a circular fashion.

### #--> Circular "Pong" is just used to indicate that the ball, in this case, the blinking circle, will keep bouncing back and forth in a circular trajectory achieved using basic trigonmetry in JavaScript. Some tricks and calculations are done to ensure that things line up to perfection.
